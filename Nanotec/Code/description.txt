The .nprj can be loaded as a "project" into Plug and Drive Studio 3. This will have all the default motor settings on it such as maximum amperage, motor type, etc. 

You can use Plug and Drive Studio to upload NanoJ code (it is similar to C++), which acts as the code interface for the motor controller.

The Torq_analog file is NanoJ code that converts an analog input to a torque output on the motor. This is included in the .nprj file, but is provided as reference for the code running.

Other code examples are available from the manufacturers website at https://www.nanotec.com/us/en/knowledge-base-article/nanoj-v2-example-programs

If using making more reaction wheels with same motor controller, future motor controllers will have to have initial firmware installed on them via Plug and Drive Studio 2, 3 did not work for me.
