Code for Arduino to generate commands in tandem with the motor controller to control torque output of the motor.

simple_control uses PID to control motor.

CAN_vel_torq_SD will output velocity and torque values to an SD card.

PIDcontrolCANcomm2serialmonitor outputs control commands and IMU values to the serial monitor for data collection.
